# Data Transformation Analysis for Price Prediction in Buenos Aires  

## Project Description  
As part of the Data Mining course, we developed a practical project aimed at performing a data transformation analysis to predict the prices of parking spaces, apartments, and houses in the City of Buenos Aires (CABA), Argentina, using Random Forest.  
The main goal of this exercise was to focus on data preparation and transformation rather than on heavy model parameter tuning, and to analyze how these preprocessing steps can improve or worsen the predictive score.  

As an evaluation method, a Kaggle competition was created (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fcen-dm-2024-prediccin-precio-de-propiedades) where we uploaded our results. The competition provides the datasets used for both training and prediction.  

## Methodology  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical methods were used to better understand variable distributions and relationships.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification and treatment of atypical values that could distort the model.  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation using techniques such as mean, median, MICE, and KNN-based imputation.  
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensuring no duplicate records remain in the dataset.  
- **Error Correction**: Review and correction of possible typos or out-of-range values.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- **New Feature Creation**: Generating new variables from existing ones that may have a significant relationship with price.  
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Transforming categorical variables into dummy variables.  
- **Logarithmic Transformations**: Applying log transformations to skewed distributions.  

## Results and Conclusions  
The results and improvements obtained through the different data transformations were documented throughout the competition.  
This approach clearly demonstrated how the quality and preparation of data can significantly influence the performance of predictive models.
